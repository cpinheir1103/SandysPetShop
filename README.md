Cloud Commander Sample
=========================
Simple implementation of the Cloud commander project from [https://github.com/coderaiser/cloudcmd](https://github.com/coderaiser/cloudcmd). 

Provide a dual-pane web file manager with viewer/editor.

- It is useful for better understanding the underlying architecture of glitch.com projects
- It can be easily implemented into your own project if you want more robust file managment
- It supports password protection (which I suggest you enable)
  - see the file cloudcmd.js for configuration parameters and set the "auth" prarmeter to true.
